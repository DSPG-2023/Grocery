# DSPGrocery Current Operations

Estimating market size has three main components. Metro population,
population, and rural population. Metro population is the number of
people who live in the town the proposed grocery store will be in. This
is done by by parsing the name, and then using TidyCensus to get the
population. Next is the populations of the towns around where we are
building the store. This is found using a buffer around the city to
figure out the names of these towns. Then we use TidyCensus to find the
sum of their populations. Rural population is the people who don't live
in a city, but are still in the market area. This operation finds the
total population of the county, then subtracts all the people that live
in the cities in that county. We then multiply this by the percentage of
the area of the county covered by our market area.

The area calculations used in our functions are derived by finding the
distance to the nearest store in each quadrant (NE, NW, SE, SW). We use
that distance as the radius of a quarter circle to figure out how much
reach the store has. This is a rudimentary way of determining the market
region as the only thing it takes into account is distance to the
closest store, and also ignores the radius that the other store would
have. A more elegant solution to this would be Voronoi polygons or
Reilly's law of Retail Gravitation.

# Code

## Shaping the data

We needed several helper methods to shape the data to the way we want
it. `Address_Parser()` is a function to take an address as a string and
turn it into a list.

`Pop_Binder()` is a function that takes in an address, parses it, and then
converts it into a data frame with columns for cities in the county and
their populations. This is used throughout several other functions.

Our program is able to pull from the Google Places API to find the
nearby stores, but it only gives us the latitude and longitude of each
of the stores, not a distance, and not a direction. This function takes
the data frame from the API call and figures out which direction each of
the stores is in, and returns the nearest store in each quadrant. We are
converting to UTM in order to filter our data frame into cardinal
quadrants to find the nearest store in each direction. In order to find
distance to each store, we are using something called the Haversine
equation. This is a method used to find distance between two GPS
coordinates while factoring in the curvature of the Earth.

## Populations

`Metro_Pop()` is a function that determines the population of the city that
the potential store would be in. This function uses the parsed address
to select just the city the store is out of a data frame containing the
population of all the towns in the county that the store is in.

`Cities_Pop()` is a function that finds all the nearby cities and finds the
total of their populations. This function uses a TidyCensus call to find
the population of all the cities in the state, and then filters it down
to be just the cities in our area. It then takes the sum of all the city
populations.
`Rural_Pop()` is a function that finds the population of all people who live
in the market area but do not live in a town. This is done by finding
the population of the whole county, and subtracting the people who live
in all the towns in that area, then multiplying by the percentage of the
county the area covers.

# Alternates

## Voronoi

A Voronoi Polygon is a polygon defined where all points in a region
would be closer to a parent node than any other nodes. This would show
us a more accurate estimate of the market area because it would take the
other store into account because people who live nearer to that store
than our store would most likely choose to shop at that one instead.

## Reilly's Law

Reilly's law is an economic principle that states that people are more
drawn to areas with a higher population than those with smaller
populations. This is an excellent way to estimate market area, but is
somewhat complicated. Maps are usually edited by hand to account for
geographic barriers such as rivers, and there are various limitations
such as the populations of the two cities having to be relatively
similar.

## Huff's Law

Huff's law is a probabilistic model for estimating consumer attraction.
It states that the attractiveness of a store and the something called
distance decay determine the likelihood of someone visiting the store.
Distance decay is the idea that as people move farther and farther away,
the likelihood exponentially decreases that they would visit the store.
In the real world this would mean that even though a store might be 10
times more attractive than another, if it is 10 times farther away, they
most likely will not travel to it.
