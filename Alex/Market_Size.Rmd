# Main Function
Takes the input from user and computes the area of each quadrant.
```{r}
north_quad <- readline("Enter distance to closest Northern store (Miles): ")
east_quad <- readline("Enter distance to closest Eastern store (Miles): ")
south_quad <- readline("Enter distance to closest Southern store (Miles): ")
west_quad <- readline("Enter distance to closest Western store (Miles): ")

north_quad = as.numeric(north_quad)
east_quad = as.numeric(east_quad)
south_quad = as.numeric(south_quad)
west_quad = as.numeric(west_quad)



print(total_area(north_quad,east_quad,south_quad,west_quad))

```
